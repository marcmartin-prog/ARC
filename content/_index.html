    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Anabaptist Refugee Committee is a group of Anabaptist Churches working together to help meet the need of refugees that have arrived in the United States. We work to coordinate groups of volunteers in situations where help is needed and also assist in working with communities where these people have resettled.</p>

    <p>Esther 4:14 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knowest whether thou art come into the kingdom for such a time as this?</p>
