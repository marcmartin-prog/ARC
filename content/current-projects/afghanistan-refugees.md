situation1: There have been thousands of refugees recently brought over from
  Afghanistan, due to the recent turmoil there. Many of these people have helped
  the US military in some way, so it is not safe for them to stay in
  Afghanistan.
situation2: These people have been brought to US Fort McCoy military base near
  Tomah WI, and other military bases around the country. Here is where our goal
  is to reach out and help them to adjust to life here.
situation3: There are a few activities for the people at the base. There is a
  sewing center, where women and men can come to sew things. They have to
  receive clearance from the army to be given a two hour slot to sew. Because of
  demand, there is only about one turn available per month. Men and boys have
  little to nothing to do.
opportunities1: There are activity centers for the women and children. The
  children can do some activities and schooling, and the women have a quiet
  place where they can go to visit. They are asking many questions about living
  and relating in America. They have notebooks to write things down and want to
  learn. What an opportunity!
opportunities2: Men and boys donâ€™t have a lot going on. We want to see what we
  can do to help them and keep them profitably occupied. Also the point is to be
  there for them as they adjust to having their life uprooted.
opportunities3: "Immediate short-term goal is to get teams of volunteers into
  Fort McCoy ASAP and keep teams there to serve as long as the opportunity is
  available. For longer term, we want to follow God  where He leads in relating
  to refugees in America, possibly networking with Anabaptist churches to help
  refugees where the resettlement agencies are not able. "
