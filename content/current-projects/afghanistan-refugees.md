situation1: There have been thousands of refugees recently brought over from
  Afghanistan, due to the recent turmoil there. Many of these people have helped
  the US military in some way, so it is not safe for them to stay in
  Afghanistan.
situation2: These people are being placed in cities around the USA. Our goal is
  to reach out to them to assist them in any way needed.
situation3: The sudden change of culture and country is more than most of us can
  imagine. They need help learning English, getting driver's license,
  assimilating to our culture, etc.
