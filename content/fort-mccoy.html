  <h2>The Situation</h2>
  <div class="sit-text">
    <p>There has been thousands of refugees recently brought over from Afghanistan, due to the recent turmoil there. Many of these people have helped the US military in some way, so it is not safe for them to stay in Afghanistan.</p>
    <p>These people have been brought to US Fort McCoy military base near Tomah WI, and other military bases around the country. Here is where our goal is to reach out and help them to adjust to life here. </p>
    <p>There are a few activities for the people at the base. THere is a sewing center, where women and men can come to sew things. They have to receive clearance from the army to be given a two hour slot to sew. Because of demand, there is only about one turn available per month. Men and boys have little to nothing to do. </p>
