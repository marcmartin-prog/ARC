  <h2>The Situation</h2>
  <div class="sit-text">
    <p class="one">There has been thousands of refugees recently brought over from Afghanistan, due to the recent turmoil there. Many of these people have helped the US military in some way, so it is not safe for them to stay in Afghanistan.</p>
    <p class="two">These people have been brought to US Fort McCoy military base near Tomah WI, and other military bases around the country. Here is where our goal is to reach out and help them to adjust to life here. </p>
    <p class="three">There are a few activities for the people at the base. THere is a sewing center, where women and men can come to sew things. They have to receive clearance from the army to be given a two hour slot to sew. Because of demand, there is only about one turn available per month. Men and boys have little to nothing to do. </p>

  <h2>The Opportunities in Fort McCoy</h2>
  <img src="/images/eating.svg" alt="helping others">
  <div class="op-text">
    <p>There is activity centers for the women and children. The children can do some activities and schooling, and the women have a quiet place where they can go to visit. They are asking many questions about living and relating in America. They have notebooks to write things down and want to learn. What an opportunity!</p>
    <p>Men and boys don’t have a lot going on. We want to see what we can do to help them and keep them profitably occupied. Also the point is to be there for them as they adjust to having their life uprooted.</p>
    <p>Immediate short-term goal is to get teams of volunteers into Fort McCoy ASAP and keep teams there to serve as long as the opportunity is available. For longer term, we want to follow God  where He leads in relating to refugees in America, possibly networking with Anabaptist churches to help refugees where the resettlement agencies are not able. </p>
